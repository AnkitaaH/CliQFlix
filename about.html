    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>As avid movie lovers and aspiring developers, we saw an opportunity to combine our passion for films with our growing coding skills.

      The website we have created may be considered a beginner-level project, but it holds great potential. It showcases a user-friendly interface where movie enthusiasts can browse through various genres, search for specific titles.

      We are confident that with further dedication and continuous improvement, this app has the potential to evolve into something truly remarkable.

We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to our mentors, teachers. Their guidance, encouragement, and feedback have been invaluable.

Thank you.</p>
